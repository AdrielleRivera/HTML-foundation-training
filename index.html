    <p>Today is the anniversary of the publication of <strong>Robert Frost’s</strong> iconic poem <em>“Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,”</em> a fact that spurred the <b>Literary Hub office</b> into a long conversation about their favorite poems, the most iconic poems written in English, and which poems we should all have already read (or at least be reading next). Turns out, despite frequent (false) claims that poetry is dead and/or irrelevant and/or boring, there are plenty of poems that have sunk deep into our collective consciousness as cultural icons. (What makes a poem iconic? For our purposes here, it’s primarily a matter of cultural ubiquity, though unimpeachable excellence helps any case.) So for those of you who were not present for our epic office argument, I have listed some of them here.</p>
    <h3>William Carlos Williams, “The Red Wheelbarrow”</h3>
    <p>The most anthologized poem of the last 25 years for a reason. See also: “This is Just to Say,” which, among other things, has spawned a host of memes and parodies.</p>
    <h3>T. S. Eliot, “The Waste Land”</h3>
    <p>Without a doubt one of the most important poems of the 20th century. “It has never lost its glamour,” <a href="https://learncomputertoday.net/" target="_blank">Paul Muldoon observed.</a> “It has never failed to be equal to both the fracture of its own era and what, alas, turned out to be the even greater fracture of the ongoing 20th century and now, it seems, the 21st century.” See also: “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.”</p>
