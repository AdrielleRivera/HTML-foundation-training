            <h2>What is Cascading Style Sheet or CSS?</h2>
            <p><strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of 
                a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, 
                MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and 
                JavaScript.<br><br>

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility 
                and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share 
                formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition 
                in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between 
                the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br><br>

                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type 
                (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free 
                CSS validation service for CSS documents.</p>   

        
            <h2>Style Sheet</h2>
            <p>A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a 
                declaration block.
                Selector
    
                In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in 
                the markup itself.</p>
      

        
            <h2>Selector types</h2>
            <p>Selectors may apply to the following:</p>

            <nav>
                <ul>
               <li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
               <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:</li>
               <li>id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash prefix 
                e.g. #id
                </li>
               <li>class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefix 
                e.g. .classname (the phrase "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element 
                classes—specified with the HTML class attribute—is a markup feature that is distinct from 
                browsers' CSS subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on document styles; 
                see RDF and microformats for the origins of the "class" system of the Web content model)
                </li>
                <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
                <li>Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, 
                    hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any element. An ID 
                    may only be applied to a single element.</li>
               </ul>
            </nav>

            <h2>Pseudo-classes</h2>
            <p>Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained 
                in the document tree.<br><br>

                One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only when the user 
                "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector 
                as in a:hover or #elementid:hover.<br><br>

                A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes 
                a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.[6] Note the distinction 
                between the double-colon notation used for pseudo-elements and the single-colon notation used for 
                pseudo-classes.
